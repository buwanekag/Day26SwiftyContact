Your client seems to keep finding a little extra cash. I wish all clients were like that. This time the client wants you to rewrite MyFavPeople in Swift to future proof it.

MINIMUM requirements for this entire assignment:
* It must be written in Swift
* It must use Core Data
* The contacts must at least have a first name, last name, address info, phone number, and eMail
* You are to assume that the contacts have only one address, one phone number, and one email (i.e. no relationships)
* Use a TableView with standard cells to display the list
* Users should be able to Add or Edit (and save, of course) items from a detail view that uses a table view to display/edit the data

HARD MODE #1 requirements for this assignment:
* Use customs cells

* Include data validation to make sure that the phone number, email, state, and zip code entries are valid
